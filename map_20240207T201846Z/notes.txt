These are 600 KID maps.

A is amplitude: np.sqrt(I**2 + Q**2).
P is phase: np.arctan2(Q, I).
DF is delta frequency (proportional to incident power), calculated in the gradient method.

Note that the KIDs are combined by summing all data points that fall in a map pixel bin and then dividing each pixel sum by the amount of KIDs that contributed to that pixel.
